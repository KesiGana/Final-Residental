For my Interior Architecture Studio final project, I designed a luxury residential home for fictional clients Elias (29) and Asher (39), two brothers deeply connected to their Suquamish roots through their community and family traditions. The design was informed by their unique personalities, professions, and cultural heritage, emphasizing the balance between shared spaces and private areas to accommodate their personal lives and client interactions.

Elias, a sound engineer, works from home, hosting musicians and artists in his professional-grade studio. His love for music began as a child, playing drums with his mother during tribal ceremonies, which later evolved into a passion for piano. He maintains his instrument meticulously and collaborates with diverse talents across genres. Beyond his career, Elias cherishes nature and practices beekeeping, adding an earthy and personal touch to his lifestyle.

Asher, a traditional canoe maker, learned his craft from their father and grandfather, spending his childhood immersed in the art and tribal methods of canoe making. He also inherited his father’s love for hosting gatherings, often cooking and creating a welcoming environment for family and friends. Asher’s lifestyle seamlessly blends tradition with modern hospitality, shaping his vision for the ideal home.

This project was designed to reflect the brothers’ individual needs and shared values, integrating spaces that honor their cultural legacy while supporting their professional and personal lives.
